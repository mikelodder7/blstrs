This crate provides an implementation of the BLS12-381 pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction with hash-to-curve and multiexponentiation methods.

* **This implementation has not been reviewed or audited. Use at your own risk.**
* This implementation does not require the Rust standard library.
* All operations are constant time unless explicitly noted.

## Features

* `bits` (on by default): Enables APIs for obtaining bit iterators for scalars.
* `groups` (on by default): Enables APIs for performing group arithmetic with G1, G2, and GT.
* `pairings` (on by default): Enables APIs for performing pairings.
* `alloc` (on by default): Enables APIs that require an allocator.
* `ark`: Enables arkworks compatibility.
* `expose-fields`: Exposes field element modules.
